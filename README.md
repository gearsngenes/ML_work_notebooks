# ML Notebooks
This repository shows the many drafts of my flower classifier project from my nanodegree program.

## The Software
Regardless of the file type, the running code used for making the classifier was made using Python 3.x. Make sure you are using a Python 3 software, or it will not work at all.

The files are, despite the name of the repository, a **combination** of .ipynb and .py files.

".ipynb" refers means that they are in fact, Jupyter Notebooks. Jupyter, a software that enables the programming of python and other languages (ex. Julia, R) on the cloud. The benefit of Jupyter is that you can write individual cells on a notebook in different languages.

".py" means that the file is written only in python. Additionally, .py files can be executed on the command line, while cells in .ipynb files must be executed on Jupyter.
